# YetAnotherConsoleGameEngine â€“ True-Color with `Spectre.Console`

> Fork of [NullandKale/YetAnotherConsoleGameEngine](https://github.com/NullandKale/YetAnotherConsoleGameEngine).  
> The original engine was limited to 16 colors.  
> This fork uses the [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) package to support full 24-bit True-Color ANSI rendering.
